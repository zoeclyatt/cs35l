LAB LOG:

1. i made a clone of the repo using the command git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

2. from the diffutils directory, i used the command git log > ../git-log.txt to put the log of changes into the proper file in my assignment directory (the parent directory of the diffutils directory)

3. i put the generated list of tags in git-tags.txt by using the command git tag > ../git-tags.txt

4. i tried to pipe the output of git log into grep but it didn't work, so i went to git log's man page and found that i could use the --grep option to do the same thing
     i tried using the command git log --grep='maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'' but it didn't work, so instead i just used git log --grep='like this' and i was able to find the commit that way
     i created the patch using the ref to the commit using the command git format-patch 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > ../quote-patch.txt

5. i got the list of versions using git tag, then checked out version 3.0 using the command git checkout v3.0

6. from the diffutils directory, i applied the patch using the command patch -p1 < ../quote-patch.txt, and i had to press enter to skip some files and a few hunks failed but most succeeded

7. used git status command to get which files had been modified
	modified:   NEWS
	modified:   README
	modified:   TODO
	modified:   doc/diagmeet.note
	modified:   ms/config.bat
	modified:   ms/config.site
	modified:   po/en.po
	modified:   src/analyze.c
	modified:   src/cmp.c
	modified:   src/context.c
	modified:   src/diff.c
	modified:   src/diff.h
	modified:   src/diff3.c
	modified:   src/dir.c
	modified:   src/ifdef.c
	modified:   src/io.c
	modified:   src/sdiff.c
	modified:   src/side.c
	modified:   src/system.h
	modified:   src/util.c
	modified:   tests/help-version

9. i changed all the files other than the .c files by opening each one up in emacs individually and using the command C-x v u to revert them

[classzcl@lnxsrv07 ~/cs35l/eight/diffutils]$ emacs NEWS
[classzcl@lnxsrv07 ~/cs35l/eight/diffutils]$ emacs README
[classzcl@lnxsrv07 ~/cs35l/eight/diffutils]$ emacs TODO
[classzcl@lnxsrv07 ~/cs35l/eight/diffutils]$ emacs doc/diagmeet.note
[classzcl@lnxsrv07 ~/cs35l/eight/diffutils]$ emacs ms/config.bat
[classzcl@lnxsrv07 ~/cs35l/eight/diffutils]$ emacs ms/config.site
[classzcl@lnxsrv07 ~/cs35l/eight/diffutils]$ emacs po/en.po
[classzcl@lnxsrv07 ~/cs35l/eight/diffutils]$ emacs src/diff.h
[classzcl@lnxsrv07 ~/cs35l/eight/diffutils]$ emacs src/system.h
[classzcl@lnxsrv07 ~/cs35l/eight/diffutils]$ emacs tests/help-version

for the .c files, i opened up each file individually in emacs and used C-x v = to see what changes were made and modified each file accordingly
files that did not need changing;
src/analyze.c
src/cmp.c
src/context.c
src/diff.c
src/diff3.c
src/dir.c
src/ifdef.c
src/io.c
src/sdiff.c
src/side.c
src/util.c

i ended up not changing any of the files, i couldn't find any hunks that were not changing character strings

10. at this point i know i'm doing something wrong so now i'm not even sure what i'm looking for but for now i'm just going to move on

11. removed the untracked files using the command rm NEWS.orig README-hacking.orig README-hacking.rej README.orig README.rej cfg.mk.orig cfg.mk.rej ms/config.site.orig src/#analyze.c# src/cmp.c.orig src/context.c.orig src/diff.c.orig src/diff.c.rej src/diff.h.orig src/diff3.c.orig src/diff3.c.rej src/dir.c.orig src/sdiff.c.orig src/system.h.orig src/util.c.orig tests/help-version.orig

12. used the command git diff > ../quote-3.0-patch.txt to generate the diff and put it in the file in my parent directory

13. used the commands;
    ./bootstrap
	obtained patch using wget
	applied patch using command patch -p0 < ../diffutils-gets.diff
    ./configure
    make
    make check

    i used src/diff . - to check

14. first i made a commit using git commit -am "apply quote patch to 3.0" to save my current work and i created a patch for this version using the command git tag v3.0-patched
    copied the old version by checking out v3.0 using the command cp -R /u/eng/class/classzcl/cs35l/eight/diffutils /u/eng/class/classzcl/cs35l/eight/diffutils-3.0
    copied the new version by checking out v3.0-patched using the command cp -R /u/eng/class/classzcl/cs35l/eight/diffutils /u/eng/class/classzcl/cs35l/eight/diffutils-3.0-patch
    used D/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt but it said there was no such file or directory so i just took off the preceding D/

15. after using the command diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt i found that there were a lot of differences but i'm not sure if the were innocuous
