HOMEWORK LOG:

generating key pair:
	   gpg --gen-key enter
	   1 enter
	   2048 enter
	   0 enter
	   y enter
	   zoeclyatt enter
	   zoeclyatt@g.ucla.edu enter
	   *i tried this twice and kept getting "problem with the agent: No pinentry" before it would cancel the key generation, but someone on the internet had the same problem and apparently it was because I had X11 forwarding enabled so i needed to use unset DISPLAY, and after that I was able to successfully generate a key after entering my passphrase)

exporting public key:
	  gpg --export -a zoeclyatt > hw-pubkey.asc

creating detached signature:
	 gpg --output hw-pubkey.sig --sign hw-pubkey.asc

questions:
	1. if other people had been observing all the bytes going across the network in my lab exercise, the network would still be secure because the data would be encrypted because i used my ssh key, which would be the same if they had tapped my keyboard. if i was booting off a usb and someone else temporarily had physical control of that usb, then they could harvest my private key and keystrokes (which would give them access to my passphrase)
	2. the gpg --verify command doesn't really verify that you personally created the file in question because you could have obtained the file from elsewhere before signing it. i don't think this problem can be fixed because you could only check if the user is the owner of the file, not if they actually created the file.
