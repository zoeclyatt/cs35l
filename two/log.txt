LAB LOG:

1. logged into lnxsrv09@seas.ucla.edu with X11 forwarding; had to create a .ssh directory using mkdir

2. generated ssh key with ssh-keygen, which generated the keys id_rsa (only owner has permissions, so it is the private one)  and id_rsa.pub (everyone has read permissions, so it is the public one)

3. the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys did not exist on lnxsrv10 but it was created when i shared my key with the server using ssh-copy-id

4. when i tried to log into lnxsrv10 again i was prompted for my passphrase

5. after running eval `ssh-agent` and ssh-add i was no longer prompted for a password when trying to log in

6. when logging in with -X i was able to see eyes pop up on my screen after running xeyes

7. i was able to log in from lnxsrv09 to lnxsrv10 and from lnxsrv10 to lnxsrv07 and run xeyes from there using ssh -XA ...
