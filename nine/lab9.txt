LAB 9 LOG:

1. used man -k disk usage to find the du command. the directory is using 590312 bytes. the git repo is using 424356 bytes. the ./.git/objects/pack and ./.git/objects/info files consume most of the repo space because that is where all the objects and their onfo are stored.

2. using the command git branch | wc -l i found that there were 176 local branches and using git branch -r | wc -l i found that there were 177 remote branches

3. using git remote -v, i found that there were 2 remote repos, origin (found in /u/cs/fac/eggert/src/gnu/emacs) and savannah (found at https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git)

4. used command git branch --sort=-committerdate (- to get the date in descending order). the 10 most recent committs are:
* master
  scratch/joaot/make-completion-at-point-function
  feature/windows-with-utils
  scratch/completion-api
  scratch/a-modest-completion-redesign-proposal
  scratch/fido-mode
  feature/gnus-select2
  feature/extend_face_id
  scratch/jit-lock-antiblink-cleaned-up
  emacs-26

5. from the master branch, i used the command git log | grep -E '^commit ' | wc -l to count the commits (there were 141268)

6. 97% of commits in any branch are also in the master branch. used command git log --oneline | wc -l to get number of commits in master branch, git log --oneline | wc -l to get number of commits from all branches, then i did simple division (141268/145595 = 0.97)

7. used command git log --since=2013 | grep -E "^Author: " | sort | uniq -c | sort -gr | head -n 10. (leading number is commit count)
